Esoteric programming
====================

>An esoteric programming language is (according to Wikipedia) "a programming language designed as a test of the boundaries of computer programming language design, as a proof of concept, or as a joke. There is usually no intention of the language being adopted for mainstream programming."

Usually programming (commercially) begins to get tired, and brains require entertainment. My first esoteric language - it's a BrainF***.
